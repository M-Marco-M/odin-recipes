This project is about realize a simple recipe's website. 
I'll need to use more page and adding link between them.

For a success of the project is important to have some knowledge about the 
basics of HTML and about filesystem.

I will put effort on the organization of the work and a good use of git, especially
for the command "commit".

P.S. Sorry for my bad english, I'll put some effort on this too.
