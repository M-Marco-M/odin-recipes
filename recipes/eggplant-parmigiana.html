    <h2 class="scnd-title">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the aubergine Parmigiana, first wash the aubergines, clean them and cut them into slices about half a centimeter thick lengthwise. Once cut, arrange the slices in layers in a colander, sprinkle with salt between one layer and the other. This procedure is useful for purging the aubergines. Place the colander on a plate or in a bowl and cover it with a plate or, better yet, with a weight that presses it. Leave them for 1 hour or for the time necessary to drain the vegetable water. When the aubergines have lost it, pat them dry (there is no need to wash them again).</li>
        <li>Fry the chopped onion and the crushed garlic with 2-3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, remove the garlic, add the tomato puree, basil, salt, pepper and cook the sauce for 15-20 minutes ( some add half a teaspoon of sugar).</li>
        <li>Now pass the aubergines in the flour. This step in the process is not done by everyone, some recipes do not include flouring. Fry the aubergines a few at a time, in plenty of hot frying oil, leave to brown on both sides. Once fried, take care to place them on absorbent kitchen paper, without overlapping them.</li>
        <li>Cut the mozzarella into slices. Now start assembling the aubergine parmigiana. Pour a little sauce into the bottom of a baking dish and arrange a layer of aubergines, cover with a few spoonfuls of grated parmesan, basil and slices of mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Continue with the layers, following the same order, until you run out of ingredients. The ideal, if you have the time, is that at this point you leave the Parmigiana to compact for a couple of hours before cooking it, leaving it to cool. Cook in a hot oven at 180Â° for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let rest at room temperature. It is known that parmigiana guarantees an excellent result if served the day following its preparation.</li>
