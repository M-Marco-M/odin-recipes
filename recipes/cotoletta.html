    <h2 class="scnd-title">Description</h2>
    <p>Cotoletta is a very appetizing italian recipe.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of cotoletta's version, but we will talk about the most popular, the "Cotoletta alla Milanese" </p>
    <h2 class="scnd-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 veal cutlets, bone-in, 3cm thickness</li> 
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>100 g flour</li>
        <li>200 g breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>300 g clarified butter</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="scnd-title">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare Milanese cutlets, start by eliminating the visible external fat and connective tissue from the meat. Score it in 2-3 places along the edge to prevent the slices from curling during cooking. Lightly beat the meat. Separately, beat the eggs in a bowl with a fork and dip the slices in, holding them by the bone.
        </li>
        <li>Then pass them in the breadcrumbs, making it adhere well on each side. However, keep the bone very clean, breading it is a mistake. Press lightly with the back of a kitchen knife, creating a sort of grid that will help the breading adhere well to the meat, thus avoiding the formation of air bubbles during frying.
        </li>
        <li>Fry the cutlets in hot clarified butter. Cook the cutlets over high heat for about 2-3 minutes per side. Also sprinkle the bone with a spoon. The cutlets are ready when they are golden. Then place them on a rack or on a sheet of absorbent paper and sprinkle a few flakes of Maldon salt on top.
        </li>
        <li>The Milanese cutlets are ready to be served with salad or baked potatoes.
